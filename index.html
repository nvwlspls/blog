    <p>The easiest things would be to do nothing.  However I have decided that I want a blog and that requires doing something.</p>
    <p>There are several ways to do this.  I could sign up for something on wordpress, ghost or any other number of services for free.</p>
    <p>However I am taking a different approach, at least for now.  I want as much of this site to be from my code, or at least code that  I understand, as possible. </p>
    <p>The easiest way to achieve this is to keep it in raw html and code everything out.  Eventually this will get tedious.</p>
    <p>I am going to use this enumerate my half ass plan for this blog. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Get this basic page styled</li>
        <ul>
            <li>My aestetic inspration: </li>
            <li><a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">Brutalist Web Design</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/">perfectmotherfuckingwebsite</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html">justin jackons</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Publish this basic site on github pages</li>
        <li>Publish this basic site on other static site hosts</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The domain will point to a single instance of the blog but I would like there to be more that get updated at the same time for prosterity and for learning how the other static site hosting goes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Create something that will convert Markdown files to html so I can write posts in markdown and not html</li>
        <li>Decide if at this point I should add more functionality to the previous code or use a minimal SSG like 11ty</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I plan to use git to show a progression in this code.</p>
    <p>The 'user' should see minimal incremental updates with little to no idea of what changes are taking place under the hood.</p>
